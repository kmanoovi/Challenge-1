# Challenge-1

This HTML is a refactor HTML, in which I have made a few changes to clean up the coding.

* When viewing the HTML code, the viewer will be able to find semantic HTML elements, such as footer, header, and section.

* The structure of the elements should be logical and in order.

It is important for those with partial or total loss of sight to be able to interact with websites. I have added alt text to images
so that readers who are visually impaired can understand what is on the website.

* Heading attributes are sequential.

* The title element is descriptive and concise.

In the CSS document, I combined some attributes in order to clean up the file.
